# Understanding Your Ulcerative Colitis Medications: A Patient's Guide

## [EMERGENCY] Critical Medication Information
- Never stop any medication without talking to your doctor
- If you forget if you've taken your medication, do not take it - contact doctor/pharmacist
- Store medications properly (check if they need refrigeration)
- Watch for severe side effects or signs of infection (fever, severe tiredness)
- Report new or unusual symptoms to your healthcare team promptly

## [BASICS] Introduction to UC Medications
Think of these medications as tools in a toolbox - each one has its own special job in helping to control inflammation and manage your symptoms.

## [5-ASA] Aminosalicylates
These are often the first medications prescribed for UC. Think of them as local anti-inflammatory agents that work directly in your intestines, similar to how putting aloe vera on a sunburn helps reduce skin inflammation.

### Mesalamine (Brands: Asacol HD, Delzicol, Lialda, Pentasa)
- What it does: Works like a protective coating in your colon to reduce inflammation
- How you take it: Pills, suppositories, or enemas
- What to expect: You might need to take several pills daily
- Common side effects: Usually mild - headache, nausea, or mild abdominal pain
- Helpful tips: Some versions need to be taken with food, others on an empty stomach

### Sulfasalazine (Brand: Azulfidine)
- What it does: Similar to mesalamine but uses an older formula
- How you take it: Pills
- What to expect: Usually taken 3-4 times daily
- Common side effects: Might cause headaches or upset stomach at first
- Helpful tips: Take with folic acid supplements, as recommended by your doctor

## [STEROIDS] Corticosteroids
Think of steroids as powerful inflammation fighters that work quickly - like a fire extinguisher for a flare-up. They're not for long-term use but can be very helpful for short periods.

### Prednisone
- What it does: Quickly reduces inflammation throughout your body
- How you take it: Pills or sometimes IV in hospital
- What to expect: Usually starts working within days
- Common side effects: Might cause mood changes, increased appetite, sleep problems
- Helpful tips: Always take in the morning, never stop suddenly

### Budesonide (Brand: Uceris)
- What it does: Similar to prednisone but targets your colon more specifically
- How you take it: Pills
- What to expect: Fewer side effects than regular prednisone
- Common side effects: Usually milder than regular steroids
- Helpful tips: Take in the morning with or without food

## [IMMUNE] Immunomodulators
These medications are like peacekeepers - they help calm down your immune system's overactive response.

### Azathioprine (Brand: Imuran)
- What it does: Calms your immune system over time
- How you take it: Pills
- What to expect: Takes 3-6 months to see full effect
- Common side effects: Might affect blood counts, requires regular monitoring
- Helpful tips: Take on a regular schedule, avoid sun exposure

### Mercaptopurine (Brand: Purinethol)
- What it does: Similar to azathioprine
- How you take it: Pills
- What to expect: Also takes several months to work fully
- Common side effects: Similar to azathioprine
- Helpful tips: Take at the same time each day

## [BIOLOGICS] Targeted Treatments
These are the newest and most targeted treatments. Think of them as smart missiles that target specific parts of inflammation.

### Infliximab (Brand: Remicade)
- What it does: Blocks a specific inflammation protein called TNF
- How you take it: IV infusion at a clinic
- What to expect: Initial doses at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, then every 8 weeks

- Helpful tips: Schedule infusions consistently, plan for 2-3 hours at the clinic

- What to expect: Usually every 2 weeks
- Common side effects: Injection site reactions, mild pain
- Helpful tips: Let the injection warm up to room temperature first

### Vedolizumab (Brand: Entyvio)
- What it does: Blocks inflammation specifically in the gut
- How you take it: IV infusion
- What to expect: Similar schedule to Remicade
- Common side effects: Generally fewer than TNF blockers
- Helpful tips: Often good for people who didn't respond to TNF blockers

## [JAK] JAK Inhibitors

### Tofacitinib (Brand: Xeljanz)
- What it does: Blocks specific signals that cause inflammation
- How you take it: Pills
